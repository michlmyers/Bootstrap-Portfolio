                    <p>
                        <img id="imgMe" src="assets/imgs/me.jpg" alt="My Image"> Growing up outside of Philadelphia I was always interested in music. After experimenting with multiple
                        instruments I eventually settled on the drumset. I began to write music and play in local bands before
                        being accepted to Berklee College of Music, in Boston, and majoring in their Music Business program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After graduating from Berklee I moved to New York to land a job on the business side of the music industry, working with
                        performing rights organizations, radio, and record labels. During this time I have continued to remain
                        interested in my creative side by writing music with local bands. Web development is a natural expansion
                        of my creative and business experience for the next stage in my life. I currently reside in Jersey
                        City with my wife and dog.
